Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons"). For this purpose, the owner(s) hereby
dedicate(s) this Work to the public domain, surrendering all rights in
the Work, including existing and future Copyright and Related Rights,
to the fullest extent permitted by law. By doing so, the owner(s) intend
to encourage use of the Work by the public on their own terms and
conditions for any lawful purpose (though they may still choose to enforce
moral rights where available in a particular jurisdiction).

For the avoidance of doubt, the owner(s) hereby state(s) that:

1. to the extent possible under applicable law, this dedication of the
   Work to the public domain is an irrevocable and perpetual
   surrender of all existing and future Copyright and Related Rights
   with respect to the Work;

2. to the extent possible under applicable law, this dedication of the
   Work to the public domain is a permanent relinquishment by the
   owner(s) of all present and future moral rights relating to the Work
   (such as rights of attribution, personality, privacy and similar or
   analogous rights);

3. to the extent possible under applicable law, and without further
   formalities or any other legal or procedural steps, the owner(s)
   hereby waive(s), abandon(s) and relinquish(es) all moral rights
   relating to the Work;

4. to the extent possible under applicable law, the owner(s) hereby
   dedicate(s) the Work to the public domain worldwide under the terms
   of this dedication and waive(s), abandon(s), surrender(s), relinquish(es)
   and disclaim(s) any and all moral rights in the Work worldwide, to the
   fullest extent permitted by law; and

5. to the extent possible under applicable law, owner(s) hereby promise(s)
   that no one will be able to successfully assert a claim to enforce any
   moral rights relating to the Work arising under applicable law.

For the avoidance of doubt, by applying this dedication, the owner(s) do
not make any representation or warranty that the Work is or shall remain free
from any third party rights, including third party moral rights. The
owner(s) do not purport to assign or transfer any of their own Copyright or
Related Rights in the Work, or any moral rights they may have. To the extent
possible under applicable law, the owner(s) waive any claim to all moral
rights that may exist with respect to this dedication, to allow this
dedication to operate fully in accordance with its terms.

The owner(s) understand that this dedication is irrevocable and cannot be
revoked under any circumstances.

For the avoidance of doubt, this dedication does not, by itself, be construed
as a grant of permission to use any other works to which the owner(s) do not
hold Copyright or Related Rights.

This dedication does not apply to any third party content included in the
Work or any third party materials otherwise used in connection with the
Work.

The owner(s) make no representation or warranty with respect to the Work
other than that this dedication, to the extent possible under applicable
law, is effective and irrevocable.

Unless required by copyright law, no further action or formalities are
required to make this dedication effective.

In witness whereof, the owner(s) have executed this dedication on the
date(s) below.
